## GSoC-Proposal
Submitted a project proposal to Jabref as part of the Google Summer of Codeâ€™ 21 application process.

**Project**: Mindmaps for JabRef
**Organization**: [JabRef](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref)

- Developed a comprehensive project proposal detailing the architecture, features, and timeline for organising the library entries in a mindmap way such that each item is annotated with more mindmap nodes. Thus, making it easy for the user to organize the references.
- Collaborated with mentors and the open-source community to refine project ideas and improve proposal quality.
- Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills and technical knowledge in Java and [D3.JS.]([url](https://github.com/d3/d3))
- Participated in discussions, code reviews, and provided feedback on existing open-source projects.
- Although not selected, the GSoC application process was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my understanding of open-source development practices and strengthened my technical skills.
